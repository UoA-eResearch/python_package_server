# CeR Python Package Server

This is a GitHub pages site, that serves as a CeR Python repository server that conforms to [Pep 503](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/)

It's inspired by the [blog post on using GitHub (or other providers) as a PyPy Server](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2).
